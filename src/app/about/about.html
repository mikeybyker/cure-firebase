          An <a href="https://www.angularjs.org/">Angular</a> 1.5 (@1.6.0) app with a <a href="https://firebase.google.com/">Firebase</a>          backend. View and rate albums/releases by The Cure. These are from my collection - CDs only.<br> I used <a href="http://www.collectorz.com/music/">Music Collector</a>          to scan my CDs and export the data, with a little massaging to get a Firebase friendly denormalized state.<br>          One day I might get round to adding my vinyl etc. too - though that would take a long, long time. I have lots :-)

          The CD cover images are as exported from Music Collector - far too many to rename to something nice, so they are what they
          are.
